<h1>How To deploy a simple flask app on azure</h1>
<p>In this project we will learn to deploy a simple flask app on azure portal. Here I have given all the required links to microsoft offical documentation. You can follow the steps as per my guidance. Please note that </p>
<p>Azure gives us multiple ways to deploy and manage applications on cloud.
Cloud is not all about application deployment but it has wide range of services to manage storage, scale resources, develop a data engineering architecture for data analysis and much more</p>
<p>
<h2> Following are the ways by which we can deploy a flask app on azure </h2>
<ol>
<li>Using Azure App Services:<br>
<p>Azure App Service is an HTTP-based service for hosting web applications, REST APIs, and mobile back ends. You can develop in your favorite language, be it .NET, .NET Core, Java, Ruby, Node.js, PHP, or Python. Applications run and scale with ease on both Windows and Linux-based environments.

App Service not only adds the power of Microsoft Azure to your application, such as security, load balancing, autoscaling, and automated management. You can also take advantage of its DevOps capabilities, such as continuous deployment from Azure DevOps, GitHub, Docker Hub, and other sources, package management, staging environments, custom domain, and TLS/SSL certificates.

With App Service, you pay for the Azure compute resources you use. The compute resources you use are determined by the App Service plan that you run your apps on. For more information, see Azure App Service plans overview.</p>
refer https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/overview for more information.

To deploy a flask app without database you can follow the  documentation mentioned below<br>
